<h1>Who Are We?</h1>
<p>We are Evergreen Student Problem Solvers (ESPS), a group of concerned students and educators. We are collaborating to
    solve problems within Evergreen Public Schools (EPS), specifically making a big impact on budget cuts.
    <p>Please <a href="/esps/join-us">join us</a> in solving the problems of the Evergreen School District. Your voice matters and
    you can make change.</p>
<p>Although EPS has been successful in passing recent levies, the last Operations Levy passed by a narrow margin. There are real
    concerns about the success of future levies. The next Operations Levy will be on the ballot in two years. We need to educate our
    community about the need for additional school funding.</p>
<p>Evergreen Public Schools has made budget cuts for the last three consecutive years. The district is expected to face
    a $16 to $20 million budget shortfall for the 2024-25 school year. This is not acceptable and negatively
    impacts all student learners. But there is hope through action!</p>
<p>We need community members to vote in favor of the next levy. Ensuring that children receive the best education
    possible is the responsibility of the entire community, not just families with students currently enrolled. The
    children being educated in our current public school system will one day be the legislators, care-takers, and
    providers for our aging population, and will have a huge impact on our society as a whole.</p>
<p>So we ask that you start by <a href="/esps/join-us">joining the ESPS</a>.  If you are a student looking to save a
    program, an educator seeking support in teaching, or a community member looking to be more involved, this is your
    opportunity.</p>
