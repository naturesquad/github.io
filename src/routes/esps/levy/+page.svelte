	Have questions about the levy? We have answers! Here are some frequently asked questions about the levy.
	All information is sourced from the district‚Äôs <a href="https://www.evergreenps.org/levy">levy page</a>.
</p>

<details>
	<summary>What is a levy?</summary>
	<p>
		Our district is funded by two different levies: an Operations Levy, and Technology Levy. The Operations Levy funds
		educational programs and day-to-day operations of schools. Things like:
	<ul>
		<li>Teachers and staff support <span class="emoji">üë®‚Äçüè´</span>
		<li>Extracurricular activities (music, arts, athletics) <span class="emoji">üéµ üñåÔ∏è ‚öΩ</span>
		<li>Classroom textbooks, equipment and supplies <span class="emoji">üìñ üéí</span>
		<li>Student transportation <span class="emoji">üöå</span>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The separate Technology Levy funds chromebooks, software, and other technology improvements. Levies do not fund
		building improvements or construction, which are funded through bonds.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>When is the next levy?</summary>
	<p>
		The most recent Operations Levy was approved on April 26, 2022, and funds educational programs from 2023 through
		2025. The next Operations Levy will come to the public for a vote early in 2025.
</details>
<details>
	<summary>How much impact does the levy have on the budget?</summary>
	<p>Local levies and fees make up 14% of the district‚Äôs budget. The Operations Levy in particular makes up 11% of the
		district‚Äôs budget. Passing the levy has a big impact on whether programs get cut.

<details>
	<summary>What programs does the levy fund?</summary>
	<p>The Operations Levy funds a huge variety of programs and learning activities for our students. From smaller class
		sizes and extra curricular activities to learning media and transportation, the Operations Levy supports it all.

<details>
	<summary>How does the levy impact my taxes?</summary>
	<p>The Operations Levy is not a new tax. Our current Operations Levy funds educational programs through 2025. The next
		Operations Levy will fund student learning from 2026 through 2028.
	<p>Our current Operations Levy tax rate is $1.70 per $1,000 of assessed property value. When coupled with our existing Bond
		Measure and Technology Levy, the total school tax rate is $3.48 per $1,000 of assessed property value. Our current
		school tax rate is the lowest it has been since 2018.

	<p>Another benefit of passing the levy, is that the state provides matching Equalization Funds for districts with
		passed
		levies. Our district is eligible for a total of $22.9 million in state Equalization Funds between 2022 and 2025,
		because our 2022 Operations Levy passed. See the table below from 2022 for a summary of the equalization funds from
		the 2022 Levy.
