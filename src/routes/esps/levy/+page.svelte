<h2>What is a levy?</h2>

<p>Our district is funded by two different levies. An Operations Levy, and Technology levy. The Operations Levy funds educational programs and day-to-day operations of schools. Things like:
<ul>
<li>Teachers and staff support
<li>Extracurricular activities (music, arts, athletics)
<li>Classroom textbooks, equipment and supplies
<li>Student transportation
</ul>
<p>The separate Technology Levy funds chromebooks, software and other technology improvements. Levies do not fund building
	improvements or construction, which are funded through bonds.

<h2>When is the next levy?</h2>

<p>The most recent Operations Levy was approved on April 26, 2022, and funds educational programs from 2023 through 2025.
	The next levy will come to the public for a vote early in 2025.


<h2>How much impact does the levy have on the budget?</h2>

<p>Local levies and fees make up 14% of the district’s budget. The Operations Levy in particular makes up 11% of the
	district’s budget. Passing the levy has a big impact on whether programs get cut.

<h2>What programs does the levy fund?</h2>

<p>The Operations Levy funds a huge variety of programs and learning activities for our students. From smaller class
	sizes and extra curricular activities to learning media and transportation, the Operations Levy supports it all.

<h2>How does the levy impact my taxes?</h2>

<p>The Operations Levy is not a new tax. Our current Operations Levy funds educational programs through 2025. The next
	Operations Levy will fund student learning from 2026 through 2028.

<p>Our current Operations Levy tax rate is $1.70 per $1,000 of assessed value. When coupled with our existing Bond
	measure and Technology Levy, the total school tax rate is $3.48 per $1,000 of assessed property value. Our current
	school tax rate is the lowest it has been since 2018.

<p>Another benefit of passing the levy, is that the state provides matching Equalization Funds for districts with passed
	levies. Our district is eligible for a total of $22.9 million in state Equalization Funds between 2022 and 2025,
	because our 2022 Operations Levy passed. See the table below from 2022 for a summary of the equalization funds from
	the 2022 Levy.
