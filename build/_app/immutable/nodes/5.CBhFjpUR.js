Over half of the district’s
revenue comes from the state government. Much of the state revenue is for general use, but some of it is designated for
special purposes like special education and transportation. The district also receives money from the federal government
that is designated for special purposes. The main local sources of revenue are the Operations Levy and the Technology
Levy. The last revenue source is Federal ESSER funds that were designed to provide COVID relief, but are expiring with
the 23-24 school year. ESSER funds will not be available for 24-25.</p> <figure><figcaption>22-23 General Fund Revenue - $409,785,461</figcaption> <img alt="budget pie char"></figure> <h2>What is causing the budget shortfall?</h2> <p>The biggest factor impacting the budget is enrollment. Enrollment in public education is in decline all over the state.
Some of the district’s funding is allocated on a per student basis. With fewer students enrolled, the district receives
less money. Another factor is that emergency COVID relief (ESSER) funds are expiring in 2024. ESSER funds accounted for
5% of the district’s revenue in 22-23.</p><p>Inflation is another major factor, with rising costs for supplies, electricity, and fuel for school buses all making a
dent in the budget. Another factor is an underfunded special education mandate from the state. Our district is required
to provide a certain level of support for students with special needs, but doesn’t receive enough funding from the state
to cover the cost for that level of support.</p><h2>How is enrollment changing over time?</h2> <p>Enrollment in our district has been on a steady decline for the past eight years, with a particularly sharp drop
immediately following the 2020 pandemic. Middle school and high school enrollment levels have remained fairly consistent,
with the most decline being seen at the elementary level. As time passes we will see a wave in enrollment decline go
through our middle and high schools, as elementary students get older. Enrollment is predicted to continue to decrease
at least through 2027. <img alt="student FTE bar chart"></p><p>Please visit the district’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/evergreenps.org/budget-fiscal-services/budget">budget page</a> for more information.</p>`,!0);function B(t,o){_(o,!1),S();var r=b(t,!0,C),n=y(r),l=e(e(n,!0)),i=e(e(l,!0)),h=a(i),d=e(e(h,!0));s(d,"src",T);var c=e(e(i,!0)),u=e(e(c,!0)),p=e(u),f=e(p),g=e(e(f,!0)),m=e(a(g));s(m,"src",R),v(t,r),E()}export{B as component};
